# php-projects
Old personal projects I did to teach myself web development; mostly PHP.

## custom-wordpress-theme
This is the theme used on my old WordPress blog, [JackDurrant.com](http://jackdurrant.com). I was still unfamiliar with PHP when I wrote most of this code, but I think this project shows that I have a natural eye for design.

## web-based-mc
This is a web application designed to list a digital collection of movies and TV shows on a server, allowing other devices within a local area network to stream videos within that collection. Essentially, it's like a very primitive version of Netflix.

## front-end-development
This doesn't contain any PHP code, but it shows some of my front-end web development skills. I planned for this to replace my WordPress blog, but this project is still ongoing. You can see how this design influenced the design of my online CV at [Durrant.tech](http://durrant.tech).

## Model-View-Controller
I have experience attempting to implement the MVC design pattern in Node.js. I'll probably publish the code to this repository when I log into my Linux system. I like the progress I was able to make, and the knowledge I have gained from this should be transferrable to PHP.
